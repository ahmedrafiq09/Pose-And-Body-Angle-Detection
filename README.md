##Body and Pose Detection Model
###Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a robust Body and Pose Detection Model using [mention the specific framework/library/tools you used, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV]. The primary objective is to accurately detect human bodies and estimate their poses from images or video streams.

###Features
- Body Detection: Utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to identify and locate human bodies within an image or video.
- Pose Estimation: Employs [mention the specific pose estimation algorithm or model, e.g., OpenPose, PoseNet] to estimate the key joint positions and infer the overall pose of detected bodies.
- Real-time Processing: Designed to operate efficiently in real-time scenarios, making it suitable for applications like live video analysis.
- Customizable Parameters: Provides flexibility by allowing users to fine-tune parameters to adapt the model to different scenarios or datasets.
- Compatibility: Supports integration with various platforms and environments, making it versatile for different use cases.

## Usage
### Data Preparation:
- Prepare input data by ensuring it is in the required format. This may include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, etc.
###Model Inference:
- Use the trained model for inference on images or video streams to detect bodies and estimate poses.
### Integration:
-The model can be integrated into different applications, systems, or pipelines to enhance human-centric analysis.
